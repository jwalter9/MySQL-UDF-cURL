--- lib_mysqludf_curl ---

As complete an interface to cURL as makes sense in a MySQL UDF

USAGE:

SET filename = curl([newline delimited string of options]);

RETURNS a temporary filename containing the result (readable by LOAD_FILE)

SET encoded = url_encode([unescaped string]);

RETURNS an appropriately url encoded string for use in query strings and
    application/x-www-form-urlencoded POSTS

EXAMPLES:

SET filename = curl('CURLOPT_URL http://google.com\nCURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION 1');

SET filename = curl(CONCAT('CURLOPT_URL http://mysite.com?myfield=',
                           url_encode(user_input),'&opt=1\n',
                           'CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION 1'));

SET filename = curl(CONCAT('CURLOPT_URL http://google.com\n',
                           'CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION 1\n',
                           'CURLOPT_PREQUOTE uptime > /dev/null; touch /dev/null\n',
                           'CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH CURLAUTH_DIGEST | CURLAUTH_NTLM_WB'));

The only CURLOPT options that are not available for use with the UDF are
    callback and shared memory options. (Also, your installed version of curl
    may have more or less options - less will cause compiler complaints)

Any curl options that take constants, like CURLAUTH_DIGEST, CURLUSESSL_TRY, etc.
    should be supplied with the exact constant name (all caps and underscores)
    
Any curl options that require an 'slist' for setopt, like CURLOPT_QUOTE, 
    CUROPT_RESOLVE, CURLOPT_MAIL_RCPT, etc. should be supplied a semicolon 
    delimited list

Any curl options that take a bitmask should be ORed using curl's defined
    constants as above.

    
--- INSTALLATION NOTES ---

Near the top of the source file (lib_mysqludf_curl.c), there is a #define for
    TEMP_DIR that can be modified (and must be for use on Windows). Because
    the UDF uses the standard 255 character return buffer for the curl()
    function, TEMP_DIR MUST BE FEWER THAN 237 CHARACTERS IN LENGTH
    
Note also that mysqlclient development libraries must be installed for compiling
    as well as libcurl


I will add to this README as questions are asked, issues raised, etc.
